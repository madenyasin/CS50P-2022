## Academic Honesty

This course upholds a philosophy of academic honesty best described as "be reasonable." We acknowledge that interactions with classmates and others can enhance your understanding of the course material. However, it is essential to distinguish between seeking assistance from others and submitting someone else's work. The course's policy clearly delineates both aspects of this distinction.
